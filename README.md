## Overview
The Automated Legal Document Analysis Platform is a powerful web application that automates the laborious process of analyzing legal documents. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as Next.js, NLP, and machine learning models, our platform extracts relevant information and identifies potential risks from legal documents. It empowers users to understand complex contract clauses, avoid potential losses, and make informed decisions when signing contracts.

## Key Features
- üìÉ **Automated Document Analysis**: Our platform streamlines the manual process of analyzing legal documents, saving time and effort.
- üìñ **Reading Comprehension Model**: We have developed and evaluated a reading comprehension model based on the SQuAD dataset, allowing users to extract information directly from the documents.
- üìë **CUAD Dataset**: To address critical clauses commonly asked by people and lawyers, we created a CUAD dataset consisting of 500 contracts in the form of question responses.
- ‚úçÔ∏è **Paraphrasing Model**: We integrate a paraphrasing model based on the T5-base model. This model utilizes datasets from Quora, SQuAD 2.0, and the CNN news dataset, enabling users to better understand contract clauses.
- ‚≠ï **Sentiment Analysis**: Our platform includes a sentiment analysis model powered by TextBlob, which provides insights into the impact and implications of contract clauses.
- üíª **User-Friendly Interface**: We have developed a user-friendly interface using Next.js, ensuring a seamless and intuitive user experience.
- üîó **Flask Server Integration**: The web interface connects seamlessly to the machine learning side through a Flask server, enabling efficient data processing and analysis.
- üìü **Docker Containerization**: To simplify deployment, we have containerized our application using Docker. Users can run the application effortlessly by executing Docker Compose.

## Technology Stack
The Automated Legal Document Analysis Platform is built on the following technologies:

- **Next.js**: A popular React framework for building user interfaces.
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing techniques are utilized to extract information and generate paraphrases.
- **SQuAD Dataset**: The SQuAD dataset is used to develop and evaluate our reading comprehension model.
- **CUAD Dataset**: The CUAD dataset, comprising 500 contracts, is utilized to address critical clauses commonly asked by users and legal professionals.
- **T5-base Model**: Our paraphrasing model is based on the T5-base model, which facilitates the generation of high-quality paraphrases.
- **Flask**: A Python micro web framework used to connect the user interface with the machine learning side.
- **TextBlob**: A Python library for NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis, which we employ to analyze the impact of contract clauses.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology used to package the application and simplify deployment.
